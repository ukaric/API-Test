## Notes
I documented the code so there should be no problem going over it.

I have updated the code so it reflects on the feedback provided, I will also make another branch named `no-format` where I will disable `standard` linter for maximum compatibility even tho no matter the editor running `app.js` should work.

Regarding the bug I have documented my view on it if that is the bug i was asked to find.
